## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
The idea is to create a website that provides users with information about the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Additionally, the website will offer educational pop-ups to inform users about the harmful components of e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed of correctly. Users can also input the model of their old device to earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed of correctly.

## Usecase:
Finding Nearest E-Waste Collection Facility

1. User logs in: Sarah, a tech-savvy individual, logs into the E-Waste Recycling Platform using her account credentials.

2. Location detection: The platform automatically detects Sarah's location using geolocation services or prompts her to enter her location manually.

3. Search for e-waste collection facility: Sarah enters her location details or allows the platform to access her current location. She then clicks on the "Find Nearest Facility" button.

4. Display of nearest facilities: The platform utilizes Google Maps API or Mapbox API to display the nearest e-waste collection facilities on the map interface. These facilities are marked with pins, and their details are displayed alongside.

5. Selection of facility: Sarah selects the e-waste collection facility nearest to her residence by clicking on its pin on the map or selecting it from the list of facilities displayed.

6.Navigation to the facility: The platform provides Sarah with navigation directions to the selected e-waste collection facility, ensuring she can easily reach the destination.
